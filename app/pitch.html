              <strong>Mocha &amp; Chai:</strong>
              A highly flexible testing interface so you can test just like you want.  Although it starts with a describe/it/expect syntax, and a spec style suite runner, both tools are versatile and simple to configure.

              <strong>Persistent specs with notifications:</strong>
              Keep your attention on your code and let your tests notify you when something goes wrong.  Tests can be started and then backgrounded, and notifications will update you from time to time.

            <li class='code'>git clone git@github.com:esmevane/sojourn</li>
            <li class='code'>cd sojourn</li>
            <li class='code'>npm install</li>
            <li class='code'>rm -rf .git</li>
            <li class='code'>npm run dev</li>

          <p>
            This fires up the dev server, running by default on <span class='code'>localhost:9001</span>.  Styling boilerplate is already there.  Any changes you make to the code in the <span class='code'>assets</span> folder will persist while the dev server is running, and compile to <span class='code'>app/assets</span>.

            Want to get your app ready for prime time?  Just do this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class='code'>npm run build</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Want to run the test suite?  That's easy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class='code'>npm test</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Want to keep the test suite running in the background, and rerun the suite every time you update it?  That's easy, too:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class='code'>npm run tdd</li>
          </ul>
